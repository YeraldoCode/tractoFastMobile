## Assets Documentation

This directory contains all the static assets used in the React Native application. 

### Images
- Place all image files (e.g., PNG, JPG) in this directory for easy access throughout the app.

### Fonts
- Custom fonts can be added here. Ensure to load them properly in your application.

### Usage
- Reference assets in your components using the appropriate paths. For example:
  ```javascript
  import logo from './assets/logo.png';
  ```

### Notes
- Keep the assets organized and consider creating subdirectories for different types of assets (e.g., images, fonts) if the number of files grows.
